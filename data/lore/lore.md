â€‹ðŸŒŒ The Lore of the Collectiverse
â€‹Chapter I: The Cosmic Flux
â€‹In the beginning, there was only the Collectiverse, a boundless realm of pure, chaotic creativity. Everythingâ€”every world, every story, and every beingâ€”was born from a living, cosmic force known as The Flux. It is the raw energy of imagination, constantly spinning out new wonders and creatures into existence.
â€‹But the Flux is wild and unstable. Left to its own devices, its creations would fragment and vanish into nothingness, lost forever. To preserve these wonders, a group of mysterious keepers emerged from the cosmos: the Archivists of Grift.
â€‹Chapter II: The Archivist's Grift
â€‹To stabilize the Flux, the Archivists began sealing its creationsâ€”characters, relics, and itemsâ€”inside dimensional vaults called Grift Packs. These packs are small rifts in reality where Flux energy leaks, holding a fragment of the universe inside. When a mortal (a player) opens a pack, they are, in essence, cracking open a Grift and freeing its contents.
â€‹The Archivists designed this system to distribute the creations of the Flux fairly, but their true motives are shrouded in mystery. Some say they are simply cosmic librarians, while others believe they are using mortals to battle each other and harness the energy to stabilize the Flux, all for their own cryptic purposes.
â€‹Chapter III: The Factions of Season 1
â€‹Within the Grift Packs of Season 1, four primary factions have been sealed. Each represents a different aspect of the Collectiverse's chaotic energy.
â€‹The Fluxborn
â€‹The first and most primal of all creations, the Fluxborn are bright, raw-energy creatures born directly from the Flux itself. They are wild, powerful, and unpredictable, often appearing as plushable, stylized beings with oversized heads and glowing eyes. They are the playful, elemental heart of the Collectiverse.
â€‹The Archivist's Constructs
â€‹These are ancient guardians forged by the Archivists from pure Flux energy. Unlike the chaotic Fluxborn, Constructs are durable, disciplined, and logical. They are the masters of defense and order, wielding heavy relics and acting as tireless sentinels of a forgotten age.
â€‹The Scraplings
â€‹The Scraplings are a faction of mischievous and resourceful creatures cobbled together from the broken pieces of collapsed worlds. They are masters of improvisation and their bodies are a patchwork of gears, wires, and junk. They are survivors who use their cunning and ingenuity to thrive.
â€‹The Corrupted
â€‹Twisted and dangerous, the Corrupted are beings that have been tainted by a dark leak from the Rift. They are powerful but unpredictable, often appearing as a warped and corrupted version of a character from another faction. Wielding immense power at a great cost, they represent the pure chaos and danger of the Flux.
â€‹Chapter IV: The First Rift
â€‹For a long time, the Archivists kept the Grift Packs sealed away. But now, the first major rift in millennia has opened, flooding the mortal world with a wave of Flux energy.
â€‹This event is known as "The First Rift," and it has caused countless packs to spill out across the world, waiting to be discovered. The factions have begun to emerge, and mortals are now tasked with opening these packs, collecting their contents, and wielding their power. The path forward is uncertain, and only by mastering the creatures and relics of the Collectiverse can anyone hope to survive.
